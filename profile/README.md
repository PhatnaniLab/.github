## Phatnani Lab

The vision of the [Center for Genomics of Neurodegenerative Disease (CGND)](https://www.nygenome.org/science-technology/faculty-labs/phatnani-lab/) is to establish a center for applying state of the art genetics,
genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics to the study of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.
